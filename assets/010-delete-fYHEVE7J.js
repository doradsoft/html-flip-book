const e="# DELETE\n\nAs the name suggests, the `DELETE` statement would remove data from your database.\n\nThe syntax is as follows:\n\n```sql\nDELETE FROM users WHERE id=5;\n```\n\nThe output should indicate that 1 row was affected:\n\n```\nQuery OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)\n```\n\n> Important: Just like the `UPDATE` statement, if you don't specify a `WHERE` clause, all of the entries from the table will be affected, meaning that all of your users will be deleted. So, it is critical to always add a `WHERE` clause when executing a `DELETE` statement.\n\n```sql\nDELETE FROM users;\n```\n\nThe output should indicate (where x is the number of tuples in the table):\n```\nQuery OK, x row(s) affected (0.047 sec)\n```\n\nSimilar to the Linux `rm` command, when you use the `DELETE` statement, the data would be gone permanently, and the only way to recover your data would be by restoring a backup.\n";export{e as default};
