const r=`# Logical Operator Keywords\r
\r
Here are the most important Logical Operators summarized in a table.\r
\r
Logical Operators can be used for conditions as they show a result in form of a \`boolean\` (True/False) or Unknown.\r
So, e.g. if an exact value is \`True\` for a value, a Logical Operator can proof that it's True.\r
\r
| Logical Operator | Explanation |\r
|------------------|-------------|\r
| ALL      | If all comparisons are True: return True |\r
| ANY      |   If any comparison is True: return True    |\r
| AND |   If both expressions are True: return True   |\r
| EXISTS | If a subquery contains rows: return True |\r
| IN | If compared value is equal to at least one value: return True |\r
| BETWEEN | If there are values in given range: return True |\r
| NOT | Reverses the value of any boolean |\r
| OR | If either expression is True: return True |\r
