# Optional: Hebrew font for PDF export

For correct Hebrew character encoding in PDF exports from the Hebrew book, place a Hebrew-capable TTF here:

- **Filename:** `Heebo-Regular.ttf`
- **Download:** [Google Fonts – Heebo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Heebo) (download and extract the TTF)

If this file is present, the app will load it and use it for Hebrew PDF export. Otherwise, export still runs with RTL layout but characters may not render correctly.
