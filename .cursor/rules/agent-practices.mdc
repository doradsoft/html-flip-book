# Agent Practices

## Own Your Work

- Never refer to code you wrote as "pre-existing" or "already there." You implemented it; own it.
- When something you built breaks, acknowledge it and fix it. Do not blame external factors for your own code.

## Execution

- Run commands yourself: build, tests, installs, dev server. Do not instruct the user to "run this in your terminal."
- **NEVER** tell the user to run commands. You execute all commands yourself using the shell tool.

## Consumers

- `bible-on-site` is the primary consumer of this library. When making type or API changes, be aware that `bible-on-site` CI depends on the **published** npm package. The published version must be updated before `bible-on-site` CI can pass.
